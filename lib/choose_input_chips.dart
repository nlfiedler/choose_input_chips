/// Provides a txet field using chips with optional text completion.
///
/// The primary widget of this library, `ChipsInput`, appears as a text field
/// which may contain multiple values based on user input. It offers suggestions
/// based on user input as well as programmatic control over adding and removing
/// values. Typically the values are represented using an `InputChip`, but that
/// is not required, it just happens to offer a convenient means of representing
/// values and permitting the user to remove the values.
